# Abstract
      We consider a class of systems in which randomness plays a central role.These are called random or stochastic 
    systems.Randomness can then arise in several different ways.
# Background
      A statistical description is often extremely useful,and indeed,most appropriate in these problems.Let us consider 
    what happens if we start with a cup of black coffee and then delicately place a drop of cream at the center.Our goal
    is to construct a useful theoretical description of the way the cream mixes with the coffee.Our point is that such a complete
    computational solution of the problem would give far more information than we want or need to nuder stand the mixing process.
    This discussion of the cream-in-your-coffee problem was intended to introduce you to a situation in which a statistical 
    approch provides precisely the type of information we are after.
# The main body
## Random walk
### Introduction
      The simplest situation involves a walker that is able to take steps of length unity along a line.This one dimension random walk is illustrated schematimacally in figure.The walker begins at the origin, x=0, and the first step is chosen at random to be either to the left or right, each with the probability 1/2. And the next step was then chosen, and again the probabilities for stepping lift or right are both 1/2. In this example the step went left,so x2=0.This process can be repeated,and the position as a molecule in solution,the time between steps is approximately a constant,so the step number is roughly proportional to time.We will,therefore,often refer to the walker's position as a function of time.
      A routine that implements a random walk in one dimension is illustrated below.Here we gennerate a random number in the range between 0 and 1 and compare its value to 1/2.If it is less than 1/2,otherwise it steps to the left.This process is then repeated to generate xn as a function of n.Any suitable pseudo-random number generator can be used(see Appendix F),but here we use a function we choose to call rnd.
